Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis tool used in trading to measure the speed and magnitude of recent price changes in a security, in order to identify overvalued or undervalued conditions. It can be used to predict price behavior, validate trends and trend reversals, and provide buy and sell signals to short-term traders. RSI is calculated based on a security's strength on days when prices go up versus when prices go down. Traders use RSI to determine trend strength and spot potential reversals, but it is less reliable in trending markets. RSI readings below 30 indicate oversold conditions, while readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions. Traders must consider the overall context before using RSI as a buy or sell signal.
